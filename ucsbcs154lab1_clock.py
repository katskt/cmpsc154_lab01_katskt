In this lab, You want to create a digital clock that counts the second, minutes, and hours of the day in 24h time
Each cycle corresponds to 1 second
the maximum time on the clock should be 23:59:59 after that it should revert back to 0

Key ideas:
How many bits do you need to represent the time? (You want to use the minimum amount of bits to represent the clock)
How do you update registers?
